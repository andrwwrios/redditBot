# redditBot
Python API Project
This is the final project I did for my Informatics class during my Fall quarter at the UW
For this project we were asked to create a bot that interacts with reddit. The only requirement was that we don't violate reddit policies 
Through out the quarter we had already been familiarized with a reddit API, so all that was needed was to make the bot do something unique.
The reddit bot I created was made to post good morning and goodnight messages. The way the message is diplayed (etiher with emojis,
exclamation marks, etc) depends on the day. For example, no body really likes mondays, or people party on the weekends. 
This code contains the localtime() function in order for the bot to know exactly what day and time it is so it can make its posts.
